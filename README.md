# RSA-Attacker
### An Automated RSA attack tool
Since the publication of RSA, there have been multiple attempts to attack it, none of which have deemed RSA insecure so far. 

This is a tool that implements some of the feasible attacks on RSA.

### Attacks 
* Hastad's attack on small exponents
* Prime N attack
* Wiener's attack using continued fraction approximation
* Fermat's factorization for close primes
* Pollard's p-1 factorization for smooth numbers
